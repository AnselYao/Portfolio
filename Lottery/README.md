### Introduction

This is __an lottery project for Sports Department of SEUSU__. At the very beginning, it was just a joke that I said I can help write the program. The thing is, I happened to be learning front-end related programming at that very time, and I've been thinking that __the best way you learn something is to practice it on your own, seeking the knowledge when you need it,__ which especially adapts to developers very well. So I took the job without thinking.
